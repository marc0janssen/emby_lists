; Example configuration for the emby_lists scripts
; Copy this file to /config/embylists.ini (or set EMBYLISTS_CONFIG_DIR)
; and update values for your environment. Do NOT commit secrets.

[GENERAL]
; ENABLED: ON/OFF - when OFF the service responds with a "service disabled" message
ENABLED = ON
; DRY_RUN: ON/OFF - when ON no mails are sent and messages are not deleted
DRY_RUN = ON
; VERBOSE_LOGGING: ON/OFF - enable extra log output for troubleshooting
VERBOSE_LOGGING = ON

[NODE]
; Friendly node name included in subject/body of messages
NODE_NAME = NODE1

[MAIL]
; The IMAP server used to read incoming command emails
MAIL_SERVER = imap.server.tld
; Port used for SMTP when sending replies (587 for STARTTLS is common)
MAIL_PORT = 587
; If your IMAP server requires a different port (for example 993 for IMAP4_SSL),
; set MAIL_IMAP_PORT. The scripts will try to use IMAP4_SSL by default.
MAIL_IMAP_PORT = 993
; Credentials used for both reading (IMAP) and sending (SMTP)
MAIL_LOGIN = user@domain.tld
MAIL_PASSWORD = pa55w0rd
; The "From" address used when the script sends replies
MAIL_SENDER = user@domain.tld
; Use TLS for SMTP: ON/OFF
MAIL_USE_TLS = ON

[MOVIES]
; KEYWORD: subject text (case-insensitive) that triggers a movies list reply
KEYWORD = keyword
; Comma-separated list of allowed sender email addresses for regular lists
ALLOWED_SENDERS = user1@domain1.tld,user2@domain2.tld,user3@domain3.tld
; Comma-separated list of allowed sender email addresses for DV (alternate) lists
ALLOWED_SENDERSDV = user4@domain4.tld,user5@domain5.tld,user6@domain6.tld

[SERIES]
; Same settings as MOVIES, but used by the series script
KEYWORD = keyword
ALLOWED_SENDERS = user1@domain1.tld,user2@domain2.tld,user3@domain3.tld
ALLOWED_SENDERSDV = user4@domain4.tld,user5@domain5.tld,user6@domain6.tld

[PUSHOVER]
; Optional: Pushover credentials to receive notifications when actions happen.
; Leave blank to disable push notifications.
USER_KEY = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TOKEN_API = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
; valid values are the Pushover sound names, default is "pushover"
SOUND = pushover

; NOTES:
; - The scripts expect the lists (movieslist.txt, movieslist_alphabetical.txt,
;   moviesdvlist.txt, etc.) to live in the same config directory.
; - Keep this file secure; prefer mounting it as a Docker secret or using
;   environment variables for credentials when running in containers.
; - Boolean fields accept ON/OFF in the current scripts. Avoid other values.
; - If you change key names (for example to add separate SMTP host), update
;   the scripts accordingly or set environment variables EMBYLISTS_* to
;   override the paths.
